What is a Technical Study Group?

Women Who Code Technical Study Groups are events where women can come together and help each other learn and understand a specific programming language, technology, or anything related to coding or engineering.

We welcome developers of all levels and encourage those with more experience to help out those that are just starting. There's always at least one mentor or leader present to help you with best practices or to guide you through if you are stuck with a nasty problem! :)
